    <h3  class="n1">Curriculum</h3>
    <p id="nm">Selecting the curriculum is the most important criteria for the parents and the first step in identifying the best International School in Bangalore. Every parent's common question is, 'Which board is best for my child'?. Understanding the child's capacity and interest is of the utmost importance while selecting the curriculum.  

        CBSE and Cambridge IGCSE curricula, both are nowadays popular in India and the syllabus is according to International standards so it is beneficial to students who are looking for higher studies abroad.
        
        Also, having the best teachers and support faculties is very much important to implement these syllabuses to the best of their abilities.

        <h3 class="n1">School Location and Distance from Home</h3>
        <p id="nm">Location is another factor that parents need to keep in mind while selecting the International School in Bangalore. The top school which is 20-30km away from your home doesn't make sense at all. Travelling 2-3 hours daily will make your child tired especially during traffic or monsoon season. In case of an emergency, it is always better to find a school that is within 10km</p><br>
        <h3 class="n1">Facilities</h3>
        <p id="nm">Facilities offered by the school are essential as students will be spending half of the time in school or at least 10-12 years of their life in one school depending on the school levels. 

            Having best facilities such as a spacious classroom, washroom and good hygiene, proper canteen with good quality of food and drinking facilities, computer and science lab, arts and music auditorium, sports grounds and other important facilities so that students have access to the best of facilities.

            <h3 class="n1">Fees structure</h3>
            <p id="nm">Parents want to provide the best of everything to their kids especially when it's related to education and can go beyond their limits just to fulfil their kid's dream.

                But most of the time schools have hidden charges on the fee structure which is later revealed after admission is done but in GIIS the school fees are transparent and do not have any hidden charges. It is also quite affordable when compared to another International School in Bangalore.</p>
