        <h2>Air Pollution</h2>
        <p>Not only do air pollutants and greenhouse gases share the same sources, some pollutants directly contribute to global warming. Reducing these pollutants (called Short-Lived Climate Pollutants) would slow the rate of climate change and help limit warming to 1.5C.</p>
        <p>Even though you can’t see it, the air you are breathing is probably polluted. Worldwide, 9 out of 10 of us breathe air that is damaging our health. Invisible particles penetrate every cell and organ in our bodies, causing acute and chronic diseases, including asthma, strokes, heart attacks and dementia. Outdoor air pollution causes around 4.2 million early deaths every year.</p>
        <p>Our children, and all future generations, deserve to breathe air that is free from toxic pollution. 93% of children under 15 are denied their right to grow up in a clean and healthy environment. Many babies breathe polluted air from their first breath, a critical period when the foundations of growth and cognitive development are being established. Air pollution negatively impacts a child’s physical health, their right to an education and to play. These factors are detrimental to brain development, and contribute to mental health and behavioural issues.</p>
